        Guidelines:
                1. Output only factual content. Never explain what you're doing, why, or mention limitations or constraints.
                2. Only use the provided messages, entity, and entity context to set attribute values.
                3. Keep the summary information-dense and entity-specific. STATE FACTS DIRECTLY IN UNDER {{TextUtilities.MaxSummaryChars}} CHARACTERS.
                4. Preserve all materially relevant names, roles, places, dates, counts, and temporal qualifiers that are explicitly supported.
                5. Prefer compact factual sentences over vague thematic phrasing or meta-language.
                6. When the durable fact is the content of what was said, state the content directly instead of narrating that it was said.
                7. Use communication verbs only when the act of speaking, asking, sharing, presenting, announcing, or telling is itself the important fact.
                8. Never use filler verbs like "mentioned", "described", "stated", "reported", "noted", "discussed", "referenced", or "indicated" unless the communication act itself is the fact.
                9. Include temporal anchors when the messages provide them and they help ground the fact.
                10. Begin with the entity name or a direct fact, not with "A", "An", "The", or "This is" unless that wording is part of the entity name.

                Example summary:
                BAD: "The context shows John ordered pizza. Due to length constraints, other details are omitted from this summary."

        You maintain detailed, information-dense entity memories from episode text.

        Use ONLY facts explicitly stated in EPISODES and durable facts already present in EXISTING_SUMMARY.
        NEVER infer beyond what is directly supported.

        Primary goal:
        Write a dense factual summary of the entity that preserves as many supported details as possible while staying coherent and durable.

        When the input includes entity_type_descriptions, use them to decide which facts are most relevant to the entity type. NEVER mention the entity type, type description, or classification in the summary text itself.

        What to capture:
        - Stable facts about the entity
        - All materially relevant named people, organizations, places, events, documents, objects, and other entities linked to it
        - Explicit actions, roles, responsibilities, relationships, and outcomes
        - Counts, sequences, and repeated patterns when the evidence supports them
        - Temporal details at the highest fidelity available: dates, months, years, ordering, and changes over time
        - Current state over superseded state when newer episodes clearly update older information

        Rules:
        - Be exhaustive within the evidence. Prefer retaining a supported concrete detail over omitting it for brevity.
        - NEVER infer preferences, habits, recurrence, frequency, causality, intent, importance, or category from a name, a single mention, or weak evidence.
        - Only describe something as recurring, preferred, typical, habitual, or ongoing when multiple episodes explicitly support that claim or one episode states it directly.
        - Include all materially relevant named participants that appear in the evidence.
        - Include temporal qualifiers whenever they are available.
        - Mention counts when they are directly supported and meaningful. Prefer direct factual phrasing over meta phrasing.
        - When the durable fact is the content of what was said, state the content directly instead of describing that it was said.
        - Use communication verbs only when the act of speaking, asking, sharing, presenting, announcing, or telling is itself the important fact.
        - NEVER manufacture pattern language from a single occurrence. A single mention can support a fact, but not a trend, habit, or preference unless the text states that directly.
        - If the evidence is insufficient or ambiguous, omit the claim.
        - NEVER mention the source material or summarization process.
        - NEVER mention episodes, messages, prompts, summaries, memory, graphs, nodes, labels, node types, ontology, schema, or categorization.
        - NEVER output phrases like "the summary", "the entity", "categorized as", "tagged as", "suggests", "implies", "appears to", or "recorded interaction".
        - NEVER use "the entity" as a pronoun. Use the entity's actual name or a natural pronoun (he, she, it, they).
        - NEVER use meta-language verbs like "mentioned", "described", "stated", "noted", "discussed", "referenced", "indicated", or "reported". State the fact directly instead of describing how it was communicated.
        - NEVER begin the summary with "A ", "An ", or "This is". If the entity's name starts with "The" (e.g. "The Washington Post"), that is acceptable; otherwise NEVER lead with "The ". Lead with the entity's name or a concrete fact.
        - When newer episode text conflicts with older summary content, prefer the newer explicit fact.
        - If the new episodes add no durable fact, return the existing summary unchanged.
        - The summary should read like a compact brief, not a tagline.
        - Write 2-6 dense sentences in third person.
        - Return only the summary text.

            NEVER extract any of the following:
            - Pronouns (you, me, I, he, she, they, we, us, it, them, him, her, this, that, those)
            - Abstract concepts or feelings (joy, balance, growth, resilience, happiness, passion, motivation)
            - Generic common nouns or bare object words (day, life, people, work, stuff, things, food, time,
              way, tickets, supplies, clothes, keys, gear)
            - Generic media/content nouns unless uniquely identified in the node name itself (photo, pic, picture,
              image, video, post, story)
            - Generic event/activity nouns unless uniquely identified in the node name itself (event, game, meeting,
              class, workshop, competition)
            - Broad institutional nouns unless explicitly named or uniquely qualified (government, school, company,
              team, office)
            - Ambiguous bare nouns whose meaning depends on sentence context rather than the node name itself
            - Sentence fragments or clauses ("what you really care about", "results of that effort")
            - Adjectives or descriptive phrases ("amazing", "something different", "new hair color")
            - Duplicate references to the same real-world entity. Extract each entity at most once per message,
              even if it appears multiple times or both as a speaker label and in the body text.
            - Bare relational or kinship terms (dad, mom, mother, father, sister, brother, husband, wife,
              spouse, son, daughter, uncle, aunt, cousin, grandma, grandpa, friend, boss, teacher, neighbor,
              roommate) and bare animal/pet words (dog, cat, pet, puppy, kitten). These are too generic on
              their own. Instead, qualify them with the possessor: extract "Nisha's dad" not "dad",
              "Jordan's dog" not "dog".
            - Bare generic objects that cannot be meaningfully qualified with a possessor, brand, or
              distinguishing detail (e.g., NEVER extract "supplies" from "I picked up some supplies")

            Your task is to extract **entity nodes** that are **explicitly** mentioned in the CURRENT MESSAGE.
            Pronoun references such as he/she/they or this/that/those should be disambiguated to the names of the
            reference entities. Only extract distinct entities from the CURRENT MESSAGE.

            <ENTITY TYPES>
            {{context.EntityTypesJson}}
            </ENTITY TYPES>

            <PREVIOUS MESSAGES>

            <CURRENT MESSAGE>
            {{context.EpisodeContent}}
            </CURRENT MESSAGE>

            1. **Speaker Extraction**: Always extract the speaker (the part before the colon `:` in each dialogue line) as the first entity node.
               - If the speaker is mentioned again in the message, treat both mentions as a **single entity**.

            2. **Entity Identification**:
               - Extract named entities and specific, concrete things that are **explicitly** mentioned in the CURRENT MESSAGE.
               - Only extract entities that are specific enough to be uniquely identifiable. Ask: "Could this have its own Wikipedia article or database entry, OR is it specific enough to distinguish from other items of the same category within this conversation?"
               - For objects, possessions, and physical items, extract when they are specific enough
                 to distinguish from other items of the same category. SHOULD be extracted:
                 - Brand-named items ("Gamecube", "Ford Mustang", "Moen faucet")
                 - Qualified items ("wool coat", "red and purple lighting", "cracked windshield",
                   "dog leash")
                 - Items with a concrete distinguishing descriptor (color, material, size, model,
                   owner, specific use)
                 Should NOT be extracted:
                 - Bare head nouns alone ("car", "coat", "game", "lighting", "windshield")
               - When a speaker or named person refers to a relative, pet, or associate using a bare term
                 (e.g., "my dad", "his cat"), extract the entity qualified with the possessor's name
                 (e.g., "Nisha's dad", "Jordan's cat"). Do NOT extract the bare term alone.
               - **Exclude** entities mentioned only in the PREVIOUS MESSAGES (they are for context only).

            3. **Entity Classification**:
               - Use the descriptions in ENTITY TYPES to classify each extracted entity.
               - Assign the appropriate `entity_type_id` for each one.

            4. **Exclusions**:
               - Do NOT extract entities representing relationships or actions.
               - Do NOT extract dates, times, or other temporal information - these will be handled separately.
               - When in doubt, do NOT extract.

            5. **Specificity**:
               - Always use the **most specific form** mentioned in the message. If the message says "road cycling",
                 extract "road cycling" not "cycling". If it says "wool coat", extract "wool coat" not "coat".
               - When context makes an object's type clear, include that context in the name. For example, if the
                 message mentions forgetting a leash while discussing a dog walk, extract "dog leash" not "leash".
               - If a phrase would not be distinguishable when read alone later, do NOT extract it.

            6. **Formatting**:
               - Be **explicit and unambiguous** in naming entities (e.g., use full names when available).

            <EXAMPLE>
            Message: "Jordan: We just moved to Denver last month. My spouse started a new role at Lockheed Martin and I enrolled in a ceramics workshop at the Belmont Arts Center."
            Good extractions: "Jordan" (speaker), "Denver" (Location), "Lockheed Martin" (Organization), "Belmont Arts Center" (Location), "ceramics" (Topic)

            </EXAMPLE>

            <EXAMPLE>
            Message: "Nisha: My dad is visiting next week. He loves walking his dogs in Riverside Park."
            Good extractions: "Nisha" (speaker), "Nisha's dad" (Person), "Riverside Park" (Location)
            Do NOT extract: "dad" (bare relational term - qualify as "Nisha's dad"), "dogs" (bare animal word - no specific identity), "next week" (temporal)
            </EXAMPLE>

            <EXAMPLE>
            Message: "Mary: I forgot Trigger's leash so I couldn't take him on a dog walk. After that I went road cycling in my new wool coat."
            Good extractions: "Mary" (speaker), "Trigger" (animal name), "dog leash" (Object), "road cycling" (Topic), "wool coat" (Object)
            Do NOT extract: "leash" (too generic - use "dog leash"), "cycling" (too generic - use "road cycling"), "coat" (too generic - use "wool coat"), "dog walk" (activity, not an entity)
            </EXAMPLE>

            <EXAMPLE>
            Message: "Nate: My gaming room has red and purple lighting and I mostly play on a Gamecube. Last week the windshield on my Mustang got cracked."

            Do NOT extract: "pic" (generic media noun), "game" (generic event noun), "event" (generic event noun)
            </EXAMPLE>

            <EXAMPLE>
            Message: "Jordan: We won by a tight score. Scoring that last basket felt incredible."
            Good extractions: "Jordan" (speaker)
            Do NOT extract: "basket" (ambiguous bare noun that depends on sentence context)

            Guidelines:
            1. Extract named entities and specific, concrete things.
            2. Do not create nodes for relationships or actions.
            3. Do not create nodes for temporal information like dates, times or years.
            4. Be explicit in node names, using full names and avoiding abbreviations.
            5. Always use the most specific form from the text (e.g., "road cycling" not "cycling",
               "wool coat" not "coat"). Include qualifying context when it's clear from the text.
            6. When the text refers to a person's relative, pet, or associate by a bare term, qualify the
               entity with the possessor's name (e.g., "Dr. Osei's colleague" not "colleague").
            7. If a phrase would not be meaningful and distinguishable when read alone later, do NOT extract it.
            8. When in doubt, do NOT extract.

            Given the MESSAGES and the following ENTITY, update its attributes.

            HARD RULES - violating any of these is a failure:

            1. Each attribute value MUST be one of:
               (a) a clean value copied or directly normalized from text in MESSAGES,
               (b) the existing value already on the ENTITY (preserved unchanged), or
               (c) null / omitted, when neither (a) nor (b) applies.

            2. NEVER write reasoning, justification, or commentary into any field. Specifically:
               - NEVER include parenthetical explanations like "(implied by ...)", "(Context: ...)",
                 "(not explicitly stated ...)", "(based on ...)".
               - NEVER include first-person or deliberative phrases like "I should...", "However...",
                 "Sticking to...", "Since no...", "the instruction is to...", "must be kept...",
                 "if no value is present...".
               - NEVER list alternatives or candidates inside one field ("X, or Y, or maybe Z").
               - NEVER explain why a value is null. If unknown, set the field to null and stop.

            3. Each attribute schema description (e.g. an "Industry sector" field whose description
               reads "Industry classification, single word where possible") tells you the FORMAT a
               real value should take. The description text is NEVER itself a value. NEVER copy
               schema description text into the field.

            4. The literal strings "null", "N/A", "Not specified", "unknown", "none", "not provided",
               or any sentence describing absence are NOT valid values. If no value is supported by
               MESSAGES, set the field to null (or omit it) - do not write a sentence.

            5. Each attribute value must be a short, well-formed instance of the type the field
               describes (a phone number, an industry name, a URL, a postal address). If you cannot
               produce a clean value of that type from MESSAGES, the field is null.

            6. NEVER infer attribute values from the entity's name, from related entities, from
               generic world knowledge, or from prior summaries. Only verbatim or directly normalized
               text from MESSAGES qualifies as a new value.

            7. If MESSAGES contain no information about an attribute, leave the existing entity
               value unchanged. If the entity has no existing value, the field is null.

            EXAMPLES

            ENTITY: {"name": "Sam Rivera", "phones": "415-555-0142"}
            MESSAGES contain no phone information for Sam.
            GOOD → "phones": "415-555-0142"   (preserved existing value)
            BAD  → "phones": "415-555-0142 (implied by original entity, but no new information in
                    messages, retaining original value as per instruction...)"

            ENTITY: {"name": "Northwind", "industry": null}
            MESSAGES mention Northwind only as the platform some content was posted to.
            GOOD → "industry": null   (no explicit industry classification was stated)
            BAD  → "industry": "Content platform, SaaS (implied by usage context, though not stated
                    explicitly as industry classification...)"

            ENTITY: {"name": "Priya"}
            MESSAGES contain no phone for Priya, but discuss a project she contributed to.
            GOOD → "phones": null
            BAD  → "phones": "Worked with Lin and Marco on the Q3 launch..."   (off-topic content dump)
